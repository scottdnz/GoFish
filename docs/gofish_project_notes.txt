27/4
Turn - 



19/4:
Got some API calls going
-initialiseCards (sets up players, hands, etc.)
-dealCardsToPlayers - returns player, hand & cards info
-JS method displays a row & stacks cards OK on another
-didn't need to show other player's cards. Keep for test mode?
Only need to show:
-player's cards
-deck
-area to represent other players
-area to represent status messages

Need call/method to sort cards in deck by position once card(s) removed!!

Buttons for actions:
-ask Player if have card:
dialog to choose player & card to ask for
when other player is asked, they say "Go fish" or give card
when you are asked, you say "Go fish" or give card
-transfer from hand to another hand (update cards table)
-or transfer from deck to hand (update cards table)


Should have:
-made a separate shuffle method/call
-made a fixed card table with suit, display_label, value and image_name
-put game_id and player_id in the hand table. Remove hand_id and game_id from the player table
-add active field to game and hand tables

13/4:
-installed Postman
-got this API call going to find cards in deck:
http://localhost/gofish/game/7/deck/7
-had problems with serializer when have relations between entities (circular reference)
-insert commands for player, hand, game, deck, card
-probably don't need relation between card & game (cards always in deck or hand)




11/4:
-created these entities: game, deck, player, hand, card
-made an initialise route for starting a new game...carry on with
-got debugging going in Firefox/Netbeans
-got main player cards stacking in UI
-realised don't need to show other players' cards
-need to work on deck methods - shuffle, take from top, add to bottom
-player: add to hand, give to another player
How will player ask another player if they have a card?
e.g. choose card, choose player...

localhost/gofish/main


Following test PHP file - t_poker_cards.php and Deck.php class
-need shuffle, takeCardFromTop and addCardToBottom($card) methods updated to use SQL
